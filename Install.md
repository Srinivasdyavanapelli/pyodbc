### Overview

Typically, pyodbc is installed like any other Python package by running:

`pip install pyodbc`

from a Windows DOS prompt or Unix shell.  See the pip [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html "pip user guide") for more details about the pip utility.

As always when installing modules, you should consider using [Python virtual environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Binary wheels are released for most versions on Windows and macOS.
