### Overview

Typically, pyodbc is installed like any other Python package by running:

`pip install pyodbc`

from a Windows DOS prompt or Unix shell.  See the pip [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html "pip user guide") for more details about the pip utility.

As always when installing modules, you should consider using [Python virtual environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

#### Windows

Alternatively, pyodbc can be installed by downloading 'wheels' from Christoph Gohlke's excellent collection of Windows binaries, located [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyodbc "pyodbc wheels for Windows").

To install a wheel, simply download the appropriate one to your PC and run the following command from the DOS prompt:

`pip install C:\Path\To\Your\Downloaded\WheelFile.whl`
